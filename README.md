# Motor-vehicle-collisions-in-New-York-City Using Tableau

The Motor Vehicle Collision Insights Dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of collision data in New York City. The dashboard is designed to identify key trends, high-risk zones, and potential areas for intervention to improve road safety. It integrates various charts, including bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, to present an in-depth analysis of fatalities, injuries, and vehicle types contributing to motor vehicle collisions. The dashboard also highlights geographic hotspots and temporal patterns to facilitate data-driven decision-making in urban planning and traffic management.
The dataset used for this analysis, NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions,

Analysis-1: Variables Used 

The key variables utilized in this analysis include:
• Crash Date: This variable was used to analyze yearly trends in fatalities and injuries.
• Vehicle Type Code: This was used to determine which types of vehicles were most involved in collisions resulting in injuries or fatalities.
• Number of Persons Injured/Killed: This was critical for quantifying the severity of collisions.
• Street Name (On Street Name): This variable helped identify specific streets with the highest pedestrian injuries.
• Latitude and Longitude: These geographic variables were essential for mapping collision density and identifying high-risk zones.

Anlaysis-2: Methods Used 

The analysis employed the following methods:
1. Data Cleaning: Missing or irrelevant data, such as null values in Vehicle Type Code and Street Name, were removed to ensure accuracy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Aggregated data were analyzed to identify trends and patterns related to fatalities, injuries, vehicle types, and high-risk streets.
3. Visualization Techniques:
• Line Chart: Used to analyze trends in fatalities over time.
• Bar Charts: Used for comparing injuries by vehicle type and identifying streets with high pedestrian injuries.
• Heatmap: Utilized for mapping collision density and visualizing high-risk zones.

Research Questions:
The analysis addresses the following questions based on the motor vehicle collision dataset:
1. Which streets have the highest number of pedestrian injuries, and what improvements (e.g., better pedestrian crossings) can reduce these risks?
2. What are the spatial patterns of collision density, and how can urban planning address high-risk zones?
3. How have fatalities changed over time, and what trends can we observe?
